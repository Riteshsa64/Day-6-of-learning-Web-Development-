<h2>Today Is “National Take Your Dog to Work Day”</h2>
<p>If youre lucky enough to work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog to Work Day.” But most people aren’t, so today is the one day a year that many companies allow their employees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round!While it’s obviously not recommended for dogs to be brought to work sites that are dangerous for them or where they’ll get in the way, such as an operating room or a factory floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.

<h2>The future of Amazon drone deliveries</h2>
<p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers that would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its delivery drones to take off and land. The facilities would be built vertically to blend in with high rises in urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one. The patent application, filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings of these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center and one that looks like a UFO

<h2>Japanese foods we love-Sushi</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef. Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around ¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.

<p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves. "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.

<h2>Meet Gaggan Anand, the 'world's best' Indian chef</h2>
<p>Gaggan was sitting in a Singapore ballroom attending the Asia's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, waiting in agony to find out whether his eponymous Bangkok-based restaurant could hold onto the number three spot it grabbed last year "As they got to five, then four, and my name hadn't been called, I thought 'that means I'm three again ... at least we matched our success, at least we're on the right track," he says."When they were about to call number two and I still hadn't been called up, I thought 'If I'm number one, I'll try not to cry.'
